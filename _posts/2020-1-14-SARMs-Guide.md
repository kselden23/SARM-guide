<summary>1.	What are SARMs?</summary>

```

SARMs are a classification of drugs that were discovered in the late 1940s and have been used medically to combat natural age-induced muscle wasting as well as disease related muscle dystrophy.  Often miscategorized as steroids, they have received more and more attention in the last 10 years for safe muscle growth. SARM stands for Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator. In basic terms, SARMs only target androgen receptors in the body, which allows them to have very few side effects. An androgen is a classification of any hormone that regulates the development and maintenance of male characteristics such as muscle mass, fat levels, bone density, libido, as well as mood and increased brain function (pending study results). Because of the selective androgenic characteristics of SARMs, they are commonly used to build muscle and decrease body fat among athletes and body builders without the massive risks of steroids or even pro hormones.

<summary>2.	Why SARMs?</summary>


Steroids have long been advertised to give massive muscle gains in short time frames. What is less commonly broadcasted are the many harsh side effects that can cause long term damage such as hair loss, anger, acne, and even testosterone production suppression or even shutdown. For many, the benefits are not worth the risks. Pro hormones promised gains with less side effects, but after their banning in 2015 they have been harder to find. SARMs do not promise the shocking results of steroids but have repeatedly shown moderate increases in lean muscle with few to any negative side effects. A common standard of measurement for side effects is the anabolic to androgenic ratio. Anabolic properties are responsible for muscle and tissue growth. The androgenic properties are the masculinizing results such as deepening of the voice, increased body hair, as well as testosterone suppression. Those wanting to build muscle desire the anabolic affects without the androgenic affects. Testosterone has an anabolic to androgenic ratio of 1:1 and is often used as a baseline since it is created naturally in the body. Many steroids have ratios of 100:100 or even 400:400. This is the reasoning behind their massive muscle gains as well as the heavy side effects. On the other hand, SARMs have much more favorable ratios. One of the most common SARMs, Ligandrol, has an A to A ratio of 10:1. This means it has 10 times the anabolic effect on muscle as testosterone, and the same anabolic affect.

<summary>3. Common Types of SARMs</summary>

<details>
<summary> Ligandrol (LGD-4033) </summary>

```
    Dosage:   5-10 mgs once daily 
	Cycle:	  8-12 weeks
	Use:      Bulking and recomping 
```

``` 
	One of the most popular SARMs, Ligandrol is commonly used for bulking and/or body recomposition. Originally designed for osteoporosis and muscle wasting diseases, it is currently in phase 2 of FDA trials. The human study conducted during phase 1 saw a 2.5 lb increase in lean muscle over 3 weeks at a dosage of 1 mg with no observed side effects. In fact, very few side effects have been reported besides very mild testosterone suppression at higher doses (10-20 mgs). Other reported benefits include fat loss and mental well-being.

<details>
<summary>Testalone (RAD-140)</summary>

```
	Dosage:   20-30 mgs 
	Cycle:	  8-12 weeks
	Use: 	  Bulking, cutting, or recomping
```
	RAD-140 is a relatively new SARM that was discovered in 2010. Because of this, there are very few clinical studies performed on its use. When tested on primates, scientists saw an average weight gain of 10% in monkeys taking RAD-140 over a 28 day study while observing zero adverse side effects. With an anabolic affect greater than testosterone, it is often considered the strongest SARM currently available. Some user reported side effects include headaches and difficulty sleeping. For this reason, it is recommended to dose in the morning. RAD-140 does tend to suppress testosterone more than other SARMs, so a PCT is required after cycle.

<summary>YK-11</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary> Ostarine (MK-2866)</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Nutrobal (MK-677)</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Stenabolic (SR9009)</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cardarine (GW-501516)</summary>

```
	Dosage:   10-20 mgs
	Cycle:	  10-12 weeks 
	Use:	  Cutting
``` 
	While often considered a SARM, Cardarine is actually a PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) agonist. While similar in function, PPARs do not have any anabolic (muscle building) activity. Instead, Cardarine binds to PPAR receptors and shifts how your body uses energy.

<summary>4. Where do I buy sarms?</summary>

```
My only experience has been with Proven Peptides (provenpeptides.com) and science.bio.  So far it is they are the only online merchants I trust. Their SARMs are manufactured in the US and provide third party tested to ensure quality and correct dosage. Both of their prices are competitive, and they offer discounts with larger orders. In my experience, Proven Peptides shipping and handling is much quicker while science.bio has the best prices.

<summary>5. How do I get the best results? </summary>

```
SARMs alone will not get you ripped. Along with taking them at scheduled dosages, your lifestyle must match in order to get the most out of them. For best results, a clean, high protein, high calorie diet is necessary, as well as 4-5 days a week in the gym lifting heavy. To help with diet, there are many apps such as “MyPlate” that help track calories, protein, fats, and carbs, and make it much easier to hit food goals. For the gym, a workout plan is nearly a must. Again, apps such as “JEFIT” help to provide workouts as well as track progress. One of the fun parts of working out is seeing the weight you can lift go up over time. During a cycle of SARMs, each week you will most likely see increases in strength. Also, while it may feel narcissistic at first, taking progress pics helps to show yourself that the hard work is paying off.

<summary>6. What other supplements can I take?</summary>

### Protein
 ``` 
 Nearly a must when gaining muscle. With a goal of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (200 lb. = 200 grams), it is difficult to reach this without protein supplement. Protein synthesis is at its highest within an hour after working out, and therefore it is the best time to drink a protein shake. Because your body does not store excess protein, it is important to keep a steady amount in your body to prevent catabolism (muscle wasting). High protein (25g) and low calorie (200) protein powders are abundant on the market. I personally use “Gold Standard 100 % Whey”. The vanilla flavor tastes decent and it is well priced.
 ``` 

### Creatine
```
 The most widely researched supplement. Over and over it has shown to increase muscle growth and muscle size. Often taken as a loading dosage of 20 grams a day (four 5-gram servings throughout the day) for 7 days, and then a maintenance dose of 2-10 grams daily.
``` 
### BCAAs
``` 
 Branched Chain Amino Acids. These are essential amino acids called valine, isoleucine, and leucine which are most commonly used to reduce muscle wasting and damage. Especially helpful when cutting on a calorie deficit diet. They are best taken before and during a workout. Take two to three 5g servings a day.
 ``` 


### Pre-Workout
``` 
There are hundreds of pre-workouts on the market. When selecting a pre-workout, look at real reviews, and research the included ingredients. The most common ingredients are caffeine, beta alanine, and L-citrulline.  I use Kodiak LumberJacked (amazon) and love the pink lemonade flavor. It has 11 simple ingredients that are proven to give a smooth pump and great energy.
``` 


### Multi Vitamin
``` 
A solid vitamin is great for making sure you get the necessary daily values of nutrients. 
```

### Fat burners
```
These require an article on their own. Do research. They can help increase fat loss but will not do the work for you. Many include ingredients that are not tested or proven.

<summary>7. What to take after SARMs</summary>


## Post cycle treatment 
```
A common side effect of steroids is testosterone suppression. While SARMs are much less suppressive, some of the stronger ones can still suppress your natural testosterone production. After the end of a cycle, some people may feel lethargic and dull. It is often described as feeling asleep even when you are awake. This is the result of your body not maintaining testosterone levels during the cycle and it may need a boost to get back to normal. Therefore, it is recommended to take a Post Cycle Treatment (PCT) with any SARM use. SARMS do not usually require prescription level PCTs such as Nolvadex or Clomid, but natural PCT are great to help regulate testosterone levels. I have used “Charles Premium Natural PCT” bought from Amazon and it worked great.

<summary>8. My Personal Experience with SARMs</summary>

```
Currently I have only run a single 8-week cycle of LGD-4033 (Ligandrol). I am 6’ 2” and I started out at 183 lbs. and 15% body fat before taking anything. I took 7.5 mg of Ligandrol every morning in liquid form orally. On top of this, I was supplementing with 10g BCAAs, protein, pre-workout, and a clean diet during the week (weekends didn’t count). After 8 weeks of lifting heavy 5 times a week, I weighed 202 lbs. and was at 14% body fat. I gained around 20 lbs. of muscle and dropped a pound of fat in 2 months.
